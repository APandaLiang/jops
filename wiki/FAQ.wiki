*My Particle System keeps running forever and ever and doesn't stop. Whats up ?*

The Particle Manager by default is in GameMode - which removes PSs once they are dead - and the PS must be limited in order for it run only once.
I have setup all of the PSs bundled with the Editor as not being time limited. This is because most effects are persistent, like a fountain or a jet or a flame, few are explosions.

To make sure it is time limited, there are two solutions:

1- load the ps on the editor.
Click on the root node that says "Particle System" on the top left tree view.
Under the tree view there should appear a few choices such as : Alive, Renderable, Time Limited,  Repeat after Limit and Life Limit.

Please activate Time Limited.
Save and use it.

2 - You can load the ParticleSystem like this:

ParticleLibrary pl = particleManager.getParticleLibrary();
//load the PS
String name = ps.setOriginalFromFile(filepath);
//get the PS
ParticleSystem ps = pl.getStandaloneCopy(name);
//change it to make sure it is time limited
ps.setLimited(true);
//place the changed PS back in the library
ps.setOriginal(name,ps);


Now you can instance it normally by using the particle Manager:
ps = pm.getCopyAttached(name);

The returned ps will be a copy of the changed PS, now time limited, and should run only once.
